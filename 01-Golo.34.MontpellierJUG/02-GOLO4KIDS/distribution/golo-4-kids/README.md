# Golo, a lightweight dynamic language for the JVM.

> The world didn't need another JVM language.
> So we built yet another one.  A simple one.

Golo is a simple dynamic, weakly-typed language for the JVM.

Built from day 1 with `invokedynamic`, Golo takes advantage of the latest advances of 
the JVM. It is also a showcase on how to build a language runtime with `invokedynamic`.

Golo is being developed as part of the research activities of the
[DynaMid](http://dynamid.citi-lab.fr/) group of the
[CITI Laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr/) at
[INSA-Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr/).

## Building Golo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/golo-lang/golo-lang.png)](https://travis-ci.org/golo-lang/golo-lang)

### Dependencies

Golo is built with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). We suggest that you use
[Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org), too. The provided `Rakefile` acts as a frontend
to the Maven build and simplifies some invocations.

Golo needs Java SE 7 or more to build and run. We suggest a fresh build of OpenJDK 8 as
`invokedynamic` advances are happening there first, before being backported to OpenJDK 7
and eventually to the official Oracle JDK.

### Building from sources

If this is the first time you are building Golo on a machine, you need to boostrap a subset
of Golo, compile its Maven plugin and finally rebuild it all. Fortunately this is as simple
as:

    rake special:bootstrap

Once this is done you can use the common `rebuild`, `clean` or `test:all` tasks. All tasks
can be listed using:

    rake -T

Of course you can just call Maven directly if you like.

### Building the documentation

The documentation is located in `doc/` and is built using [AsciiDoc](http://asciidoc.org).

The current configuration depends on MacOSX + Homebrew specific paths. We know this is very bad,
and we promise to solve this *at some point*. Or maybe we'll just switch to
[AsciiDoctor](http://asciidoctor.org) *at some point*.

The documentation can be built using the provided `Rakefile`. For instance one may build a HTML
output using:

    rake html
